                                Many don’t think of mining as being one of the world’s largest industries anymore and as such, it is no longer a very popular investment for those breaking into the realm of porfolio optimization. However, mining for resources remains a lucrative business and when done right, it can be a valuable part of any investment portfolio. There continues to be innovation within the sector and since it is less popular than many other sectors at the moment, the barrier of entry is far less and there are more opportunities to find hidden funds and investments that others are not privvy to just yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
