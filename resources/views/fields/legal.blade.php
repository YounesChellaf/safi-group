                                We have chosen the legal industry to be one of the cornerstones of our investment portfolio due to the sustained success that legal companies have had the past decades. While the exposure to legal companies to the everyday consumer is low, the fact that it is essential for our justice system to operate remains a fact that is undisputable and largely beneficial to our investor group. The legal industry has both the volume and size of transactions to make it a giant when it comes to investing purposes and that makes it appealing to us and our clients.

                                We have been able to include the legal industry into our investment portfolio in a variety of ways that both diversifies and strenghtens our position in the industry. Our firm continues to benefit from the past data that we have on our legal investments and the vision that we continue to have into the legal industry. Thereâ€™s no doubt that legal is necessary for our justice system to move forward and we have been able to capitalize on that fact by investing in quality firms, legal services, and other legal-adjacent industries. We believe in strengthening our economy and institutions through our investments as well as looking out for investor capital and we have been able to accomplish each of those tasks through our investments in legal.
