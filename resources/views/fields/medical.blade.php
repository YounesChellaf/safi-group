                                In many areas of the world, including the United States, healthcare is the largest industry in the country. It may be hard to believe how far the industry has come in such a short amount of time, but the truth is that medical and healthcare now accounts for a large portion of the money that is spent on a daily basis around the world. This has grown to one of the largest industries in the world and as technologies continue to develop and new treatments arise, we expect the success of this sector to only increase as time goes on. One thing that is becoming clear is that anyone without access to this sector in their portfolio is lagging behind in performance when compared to other portfolios.
